Form-Decor is a customization tool built in PowerShell that allows users to edit the appearance of a form.

Features:
- Change the form’s background and text (foreground) colors via clickable color buttons
- Select fonts and text sizes from dropdown menus
- Edit the form’s title text and apply font styles/text effects (bold, italic, strikeout, underline) through text input
- Simple, interactive interface for quick visual customization

IMPORTANT:
This program is only known to run in windows thus far. If you run it in macOS or Linux there's a chance it may not work.

This is the first release of Form-Decor. Bug reports and feedback are welcome via the Issues tab.
